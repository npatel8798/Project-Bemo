        {% blocktrans trimmed with n=num_choices %}
        On the following screen you will see {{ n }} hypothetical scenarios.
        In each scenario you can choose between a lottery and a safe payment.
        The lottery is as follows:
        There is a {{ probability }} chance to get €{{ lottery_hi }}, and a {{ probability }} chance to get nothing.

        The safe payment increases from scenario to scenario.
        Its value is €0 in the first scenario, €10 in the second, €20 in the third, and so on.
        In the last scenario, the value is €300.
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    {% if enforce_consistency %}
    <p>
        Since the safe payment gets better and better in each scenario,
        you should switch from the lottery to the safe payment only once.
        This means that, if in a certain scenario you accept the safe payment,
        then you should accept the safe payment also in the subsequent scenarios.
        Likewise, it means that you should accept the lottery in all the preceding scenarios.
        In other words, the scenario in which you accept the safe payment will mark
        the point where you stop to accept the lottery and you begin to accept the safe payment.
    </p>

    <p>
        Following this idea, the experiment comes with a feature that, once you select a safe payment or a lottery,
        automatically checks all the remaining safe payments/lotteries for you.
    </p>
        {% if Constants.single_click %}
        <p>
            In particular, once you select a safe payment, the feature will automatically check all the safe payments
            that follow the one you selected and, at the same time, all the lotteries that precede the safe payment you selected.
            In other words, as you click on a safe payment,
            this feature will select for you all the safe payments below and all the lotteries above.
            This means that you will only have to select the point in which you want to switch your selection
            from the lottery to the safe payment.
        </p>
        {% else %}
        <p>
            In particular, once you select a safe payment, the feature will automatically check all the safe payments
            that follow the one you selected.
            Likewise, once you select a lottery, the feature will automatically check all the lotteries
            that precede the one you selected.
            This means that you only need to select a safe payment and the lottery that precedes it.

    <p>Mind that you can revise your decision for as long as you want before submitting it.</p>

    <p>Please, indicate the scenario in which you switch from the lottery to the safe payment.</p>

    <p>Please, for each scenario, indicate whether you choose the lottery or the safe payment.</p>

            After you have submitted your decision, one of the {{ n }} scenarios will be randomly chosen for
            your payment.
            If, at the randomly chosen scenario, you chose the lottery option, your payoff will be determined according
            to the corresponding probabilities. Otherwise, you will earn the safe payment.
