    Please think about what you would do in the following situation.
    You are in an area you are not familiar with, and you realize you lost your way.
    You ask a stranger for directions.
    The stranger offers to take you to your destination.
</p>
<p>
    Helping you costs the stranger about €{{ stranger_cost }} in total.
    However, the stranger says he or she does not want any money from you.
    You have six presents with you.
    The cheapest present costs €{{ cheap_present }}, the most expensive one costs €{{ expensive_present }}.
</p>
<p>
    Do you give one of the presents to the stranger as a “thank-you”-gift?
    If so, which present do you give to the stranger?
</p>
