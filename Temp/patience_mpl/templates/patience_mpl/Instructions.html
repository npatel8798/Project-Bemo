        On the following screen you will see {{ n }} hypothetical scenarios.
        In each scenario you can choose between a payment that you would receive today and a payment that you
        would receive in a year from now.
        The payment today will be the same in each scenario ({{ c }}{{ p }}).

        The payment in 12 months increases from scenario to scenario.
        Its value is {{ c }}{{ p1 }} in the first scenario, {{ c }}{{ p2 }} in the second, {{ c }}{{ p3 }} in the third,
        and so on. In the last scenario, the value is {{ c }}{{ mp }}.
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    {% if Constants.enforce_consistency %}
    <p>
        Since the payment in 12 months gets better and better in each scenario,
        you should switch from the payment today to the payment in 12 months only once.
        This means that, if in a certain scenario you choose the payment in 12 months,
        then you should choose the payment in 12 months also in the subsequent scenarios.
        Likewise, it means that you should choose the payment today in all the preceding scenarios.
        In other words, the scenario in which you accept the payment in 12 months will mark
        the point where you stop to choose the payment today and you begin to choose the payment in 12 months.
    </p>

    <p>
        Following this idea, the experiment comes with a feature that, once you select a payment today
        or a payment in 12 months,
        automatically checks all the remaining payments for you.
    </p>
        {% if Constants.single_click %}
        <p>
            In particular, once you select a payment in 12 months, the feature will automatically check
            all the payments in 12 months that follow the one you selected and, at the same time,
            all the payments today that precede the payment in 12 months you selected.
            In other words, as you click on a payment in 12 months,
            this feature will select for you all the payments in 12 months below and all the payments today above.
            This means that you will only have to select the point in which you want to switch your selection
            from the payment today to the payment in 12 months.
        </p>
        {% else %}
        <p>
            In particular, once you select a payment in 12 months, the feature will automatically check
            all the payment in 12 months that follow the one you selected.
            Likewise, once you select a payment today, the feature will automatically check all the payments today
            that precede the one you selected.
            This means that you only need to select a payment in 12 months and the payment that precedes it.

    <p>Mind that you can revise your decision for as long as you want before submitting it.</p>

    <p>Please, indicate the scenario where you choose the payment in 12 months over the payment today.</p>

            After you have submitted your decision, one of the {{ n }} scenarios will be randomly chosen for
            your payment.
            If, at the randomly chosen scenario, you chose the lottery option, your payoff will be determined according
            to the corresponding probabilities. Otherwise, you will earn the safe payment.
